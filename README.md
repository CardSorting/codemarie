# CodeMarie: The Architectural Guardian

![CodeMarie Banner](assets/branding/banner.png)

**CodeMarie** is an industrial-grade, model-agnostic agentic coding assistant designed to maintain architectural integrity in complex software ecosystems. Beyond simple code generation, CodeMarie acts as an **Architectural Guardian**, enforcing strict layering, managing structural entropy, and ensuring transactional stability across your workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Oracle Grade Release (v3.85.0)**: This release marks the transition to the **Observe-Act-Adjust** execution model, prioritizing forward progress and reliability by removing high-latency grounding loops while maintaining strict architectural enforcement via the **Spider Engine**.

## 🏗️ Core Pillars of Intelligence

### 🧬 Joy-Zoning Framework
CodeMarie enforces a rigorous architectural pattern known as **Joy-Zoning**. It automatically categorizes every file into distinct layers and enforces "Outside-In" dependency rules. 
*   **Layer 1 (Shared/Core)**: Foundational types and utilities.
*   **Layer 2 (Services)**: Business logic and data providers.
*   **Layer 3 (UI/Handlers)**: Components and interaction logic.
*   **Layer 4 (Controllers)**: Extension lifecycle and event management.

> [!TIP]
> The **Fluid Policy Engine** monitors every file operation via the **Universal Guard** to prevent layer leaks and circular dependencies in real-time.

### 🕷️ Spider Structural Intelligence Engine
The **Spider Engine** represents a fundamental shift from static code analysis to **Structural Intelligence**:
*   **Dependency Web analysis**: Treats the codebase as a living web, sensing "vibrations" (structural shifts) on every write.
*   **Incremental $O(1)$ Audits**: Uses a CAS-hash based model to provide near-instantaneous architectural validation without scanning the entire repo.
*   **Blast Radius Intelligence**: Predicts the multi-hop impact of a change before execution, identifying potential "Structural Entropy" growth.

### 🔮 Oracle Grade Suggestion Engine
The **Oracle Suggestion Engine** transforms prompt suggestions into an architectural and diagnostic compass:
*   **Spider-Powered Symbol Resolution**: Automatically identifies and resolves the definitions of types causing workspace errors.
*   **Project-Wide Consistency**: Extracts and enforces your project's dominant idioms, error handling conventions, and naming styles.
*   **Parallelized Source Discovery**: Simultaneously gathers intelligence from Diagnostics, Git, BroccoliDB, and Tree-Sitter with zero detectable latency.

## 📐 System Architecture

### 1. Functional Layout
CodeMarie is built on a decoupled, high-throughput architecture designed for stability and observability.

    classDef secondary fill:#1e293b,stroke:#a855f7,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;

    User((User Workspace)):::primary --> Extension[VS Code Gateway]:::primary
    Extension --> Controller[Core Controller / Main Event Loop]:::primary
    
    subgraph "Structural Intelligence"
        Controller --> Spider[Spider Engine]:::warning
        Spider --> JZ[Joy-Zoning Guard]:::warning
    end

    subgraph "Reasoning & Context"
        Controller --> KGS[Knowledge Graph Service]:::primary
        Controller --> SugS[Oracle Suggestion Service]:::secondary
    end
    
    subgraph "Transactional Persistence"

        DB --> Nodes[Knowledge Nodes]:::database
    end
    
    Controller --> MCPHub["Model Context Protocol (MCP) Hub"]:::primary
```

### 2. Execution Flow: Observe-Act-Adjust
CodeMarie utilizes a high-reliability autonomous loop that prioritizes forward progress over recursive validation.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Start([User Intent]) --> Observe[1. Observe]
    Observe -- "Context & Diagnostics" --> Act[2. Act]
    Act -- "Execute Tools" --> Audit{3. Policy Audit}
    Audit -- "Violation" --> Feedback[Correction Feedback]
    Feedback --> Act
    Audit -- "Success" --> Result[4. Observation]
    Result -- "Status Update" --> Observe
```

## 🕰️ History & Origins
**CodeMarie** is a completely transformed, industrial-grade evolution of the original [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) repository. While it shares foundational DNA, the architecture, orchestration, and policy safeguarding have been reconstructed from the ground up to support enterprise-scale agentic coding.
